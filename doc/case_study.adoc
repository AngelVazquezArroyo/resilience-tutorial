_Awesome, Inc._ invented and successfully markets their product _Awesome_. To satisfy the different needs of their customers they offer it in three different versions:

* _Awesome_
* _Really Awesome!_
* _TOTALLY AWESOME!!!_

_Awesome, Inc._ also offer a free test version of their product, called _almost awesome_, for customers who are not yet sure if they really want to buy any of the full-price versions. The test version turned out to be extremely successful as most customers went for the full-price versions, once they had a taste of awesome.

Of course, Awesome, Inc. also runs a _web shop_. Actually, as their products are delivered online only, the web site is the only way to buy awesome in any of its flavors.

NOTE: Of course a real company would usually have more products in their web shop and more delivery channels. This simplification was done on purpose for keeping the business logic and the amounts of data to handle simple.

== System landscape

Besides the web shop, Awesome, Inc. runs some more services that complement the web shop:

* A _payment service_ which takes care of the customer payments
* A _delivery service_ which handles the delivery of bought products
* A _recommendation service_ which recommends other products based on the products currently viewed and bought
* An _analytics service_ which captures information from all other services in order to gain new insights

The system landscape uses three different communication paradigms:

* The _web shop_, the _payment service_ and the _delivery service_ communicate via events.
* The _web shop_ communicates with the _recommendation service_ using synchronous requests.
* The _web shop_, the _payment service_ and the _delivery service_ communicate with the _analytics service_ sending messages to the _analytics service_.

NOTE: It is very unlikely to find all those communication paradigms in such a small service landscape (or at least it would be a sign of poor design). Here we used it to have a training ground for different resilience patterns.

Of course there is also some centralized logging and metrics which are not shown in the image as they are not of particular interest for the resilience tutorial.
